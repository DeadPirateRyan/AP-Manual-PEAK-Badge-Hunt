# PEAK Badge Hunt AP Manual
An Archipelago manual made for the game PEAK centered around collecting badges.
# Game Modes

Normal - The goal is to get the Peak Badge

Plundering Mode - The goal is to gain access to the peak by completing the Plunderer Badge, which the amount of luggages you can open in one run beyond the first one being limited by Luggage Keys (needing 14 to open 15 luggages total). Also adds consecutive luggage amount locations.

Victory Lap Mode - The goal is to get to the peak a set amount times (collecting multiple Peak Badges)

Luggage Type (Choice) - There are two types of Luggage Locations, Biome Specific (which has a set amount each Biome, 10 per with 2 in Kiln) and Generic Luggage (which you can select the amount of)

Generic Luggage Amount (Range) - You can set the amount of Generic Luggage locations from 5 to 100 (the first 50 being unlocked based on the amount of progressive areas, with the last 50 unlocking with 5 progressive areas)

Progressive Area Amount (Choice) - Sets the amount of progressive areas in the game. Scarce is 5, Normal is 7, and Abundant is 9

Ascent Traps (Choice) - Adds in Ascent Traps, which require you to raise the difficulty/ascent in your next run (with a total of 7 in the pool, going from Peak Difficulty to Ascent 7 potentially)

Progressive Area (Progression) - You need 5 to get from Shore to the Peak except for Plundering Mode, which you need 4 and Peak Access

Peak Access (Progression) - For Plundering Mode, this is behind the Plunderer Badge of Plundering Mode, allowing you to get to the peak.

Bing Bong Point (Filler) - 10 total in the pool, I heard if you get them all you'll earn Bing Bong's approval

Crashed Plane Part (Filler) - 10 total in the pool, the pieces of the plane you were crashed in 

Ascent Trap (Trap) - 7 total in the pool if the yaml option is turned on, forces you to set the difficulty of your next run based on the amount of Ascent Traps you have

# Badges
I do want to preface that below are explanations on how to get every badge in the game and in the manual.

These are the main locations in the game barring the Luggage locations.
This is where I'll list every badge in the manual and explain the badges.
I did edit a small amount of badges due to the exact number of points being hard to track without mods.

There's also a handful of badges that you have to keep track of the number of the entire time in a run (like Cooking Badge and Plunderer Badge for instance). I put them, logic-wise, further along as locations (around Caldera for in logic), but they definitely are doable outside of logic. There's also a good chunk of other badges that are doable outside of logic.

Some badges will appear in other categories of badges if the badge option are turned on, like for instance there are custom badges for the victory lap badges.
